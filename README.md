Inception
=========

Inception is a starter theme for WordPress. This is designed to be used as a parent theme, so don't child theme it. Instead, take this and make it your own. While this does support child theming, this was not the primary focus of development so you may run into some issues.

If you have any questions, please open an issue; if you'd like to contribute, please create a pull request and I'll review it.

Good luck!
